  inequalities will play more and more on the ground of 'conscious use of digital technologies rather than on access, as now, at least in Europe, all of them are users of technologies. RATI has developed an action plan, to be implemented between 2015 and 2018, shared spontaneously by the schools, with the following objectives to:
  • Raise attention about the importance of computational thinking and coding among schools of all levels (Managers and Teachers), starting from the province of Chieti (Abruzzo Region);
  • Organize digital skills training courses for teachers
  • Use qualified retired professionals or young graduates and / or young university researchers as a trainers;
  • Encourage schools to organize coding courses for pupils, using the trained teachers;
  • Stimulate collaborative relationships and exchange of good practice between schools;
  • Encourage networking among schools, of all levels, for exchanging of good practices and improving teaching / learning innovative skills;
  • Build partnerships with local bodies, municipalities, enterprises, university to create a ""local coalitions"" sustaining schools in this innovation process;
  • Organize public communication events to stimulate the adoption the training of new digital skills by new schools

 As described in Project ID: 712284 ""Feasibility Study for the CBT Academy"", Cross Border Talents an SME Instrument Champion (Phase 1 and awarded with Seal of Excellence in Phase 2) strives to Recruit, Train and Employ 500,000 ICT developers across Europe by 2020 and therefore promote digital literacy, employability and retain investment in Europe. 
  
  Having the support of the New Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition - connecting our Apply-Train-Work methodology with Cabinets from Education, Employment and Diversity across EU 28- will enable CBT to achieve the 500,000 developers target.
  
  Extracted from CBTA feasibility study;
  ""Several market trends have resulted in a decreasing availability of workers fit for and/or interested in positions which require medium-to-high skills in the ICT sector (as code programming). All the while, ICT companies grow exponentially and increasingly other sectors need programming for their daily activities (Big Data). This has caused a “Skills Gap”, which by 2020 will result in the shortage of 85 million medium-to-high skilled workers and a surplus of 90+ million low skilled workers.
  - The identification of this market failure, which has tremendous impact on the performance and growth of companies (lost revenue and higher costs) throughout the EU, motivated CBT to develop an innovative business model to commercially explore this opportunity with the “CBT Academy” project.
  - Its’ business model and concept are based on organising training courses to up-skill capable low-skilled workers into medium-to-high skills code programmers. The courses’ content will be defined by the effective needs of CBT Group’s ICT clients thus increasing the employment potential of the Academy’s trainees. This concept can be summarized as “Just-in-Time Skills”, where potential candidates enter a course knowing that a job opportunity will be waiting for them if they finish it successfully.
  - More than 15 years of experience in the recruitment sector, in various countries, have validated the need and willingness-to-pay of companies for the results the CBT Academy wants to achieve (regular groups of motivated, capable and mobile workers to fill the growing positions with programming tasks)
  - To proof the value of our solution CBT has currently an ongoing pilot where a paying customer (Multinational European IT company) has signed a declaration of interest available upon request; 
  ""After being introduced to the Cross Borders Talents Academy solution and representing a company that provides services for around thirty years to key players in the Aerospace, Automotive, Energy, Railway, Finance, Healthcare and Telecoms sectors. Covering every stage of project development from strategic planning through to manufacturing, offers capitalise on the Group’s technological know‐how in five key areas: Intelligent Systems, Innovative Product Development, Lifecycle Experience, Mechanical Engineering, and Information Systems.

The ongoing digitalisation of banking is one of the major aspects of the transformation of the financial sector. As a result of those rapid changes, sector employees have to make a constant effort to enhance their level of competence so as to be sure about their employability. 
 Social dialogue at sector level
 Within the framework of joint representation activities (social dialogue at sector level), Febelfin and the representative trade unions are engaged in a joint reflection on labour organisation and more specifically on the effect of the digitalisation of banking on this organisation. Lifelong training is another subject of discussion on the occasion of social consultation at sector level. Basic and advanced digital skills are paramount in this respect.
 Training initiatives
 Within the same framework (social dialogue at sector level), Febelfin Academy asbl (training institute) and Febelfin are also developing training initiatives specifically aimed at the financial sector employees. Digitalisation is the main element underlying the fast metamorphosis of all aspects of banking and the reason why each and everyone of us must try to keep up.
 Training programmes aimed at raising awareness and improving digital skills are considered to be fundamentally important from a strategic point of view, both by Febelfin Academy and the joint representation bodies. This is a concept which covers the technical as well as the behavioural aspects.

  • To supply higher technical level mechatronics technicians responding
  to demand of firms;
  • To integrate training and labour system;
  • To disseminate technical, digital and scientific knowledge;
  • To sustain the innovation and technology transfer for SMEs;
  • To help the life-long learning of workers.
  The courses offered, related to mechatronics and automation skills, are innovative because they are shaped on new strategic scenarios industrial analysis in terms of innovation, especially for digital, automation and industry 4.0 skills.
  The joint presence of enterprises, university and technical schools, guarantees the transfer of know how to students.
  Both postgraduate education and life-long learning programmes become synergistic resources to enterprises, which offering their experience in technical, digital, automation issues, for achieving skilled human capital.
  All members of Foundation provides economic and human resources to the project (economic contributions, teachers, technicians, etc.) and the Foundation is financed also by Education National Ministry.
  In the middle of automation and industry 4.0 revolution, industrial local system, especially SMEs, are more exposed to competition from other territories. In recent years large companies have consistently increased the international profile of plants located in the region with a positive impact on sales and employment. Local SMEs are strictly interconnected to Large enterprises and they work together in an integrated supply-chain. Because they have not, generally, research department nor infrastructure and adequate digital-automation training programs, there is a real risk of relocation of LEs enterprises, in other region or countries, with related problems to productivity and employment.
  The Foundation main goal is to create an effective dual training system (which doesn’t exist in Italy) according to the principle of school-business based with a closer collaboration among business and school system with the object to improve the local employment rate, especially among young people. The experience of Foundation sees the active involvement of companies in all phases of operation with the other partners (through working groups made up of employees of companies, universities, schools):
  • designing training course modules;
  • fellows selection (made by recruitment experts);
  • technical and specialized teaching activities;

LIBRe Foundation,Alexandra Tsvetkova,office@libreresearchgroup.org,"LIBRe Foundation is a Bulgarian not-for-profit non-governmental organisation established in 2015 with the mission to contribute to the national and European digital policies and to facilitate the technology penetration in the professional and personal life.
  
  The organisation works in the fields of digital society and digital rights, information management, intellectual property rights in an online environment, privacy and security, e-government, and e-justice. Our activities include research on information technologies, organisational behaviour and law, as well as development of interactive solutions and communication strategies, organisation of awareness campaigns on key issues in our competence areas, publishing, and training.
  
  We believe in the power of digital communication and the role of technologies in improving quality of life and securing a better future for generations to come. We have identified several barriers to achieving such prosperity, among which is the growing digital skills gap we are witnessing. Thus, our efforts are focused on students and young proffesionals‘ development, NGOs and SMEs support, and state policies.
  In particular, we recognise that law students and legal professionals in Bulgaria lack technical understanding and skills needed to reflect the growing penetration of technologies in the legal practice. There is very limited curriculum on ICT Law while the need for professionals in the field is constantly growing. Therefore, we have initiated a project aimed at raising awareness and interest in ICT Law among students in Bulgarian universities. The project called ‘LIBRe Essay Contest’ is an annual essay competition open for students from various majors with interest in digital society. In this initiative we join forces with a growing number of Bulgarian educational and state institutions, as well as lecturers and professionals from different academic and business fields. Among the awards in the LIBRe Essay Contest is a paid internship at LIBRe Foundation, which is considered by our first intern as a valuable experience developing multiple skills needed by any law student nowadays.
  
  Our goal is to continue to contribute towards growing the interest in ICT Law on local and European level and developing technical understanding and skills not only among law students but within a wider academic reach.
  
  Furthermore, our activities include consultancy for NGOs and SMEs on both legal, organisational, and technological matters. Key aspects of our activities in this area include provision of legal advice on privacy and automated processing of sensitive data, and expansion of organisations’ activities and initiatives in IT-related fields.
  LIBRe Foundation is also engaged with the issues of e-Governance and e-Justice which in Bulgaria require not only major structural changes in the administration and institutions’ functioning, but also qualified administrative and judiciary staff able to successfully implement the national strategies in these fields. LIBRe experts have significant experience in training of judges and administrative personnel and play an advocacy role in the reforms in the Bulgarian judicial system towards optimised technology-enhanced procedures and processes.
  LIBRe team gathers people with wide-range skills and expertise which makes us capable of effectively supporting long-term activities related to legal and organisational consulting and project management, as well as detailed research in the fields of information technologies, data security and analytics, and work process design, optimization and management. We also engage with complex planning and organisation of public events and trainings, including development and implementation of communication strategies in specific areas of applied research.

QuickCode Labs Ltd,Mick Westman,mick@quickcodelabs.com,"Digital tech businesses identify self-taught programming as the most important source of skills development; followed by in-house training. GenZs are the most digitally savvy generation ever. As the way we engage with tech becomes ever more intuitive we need to focus on training the digital natives in the means of applying their skills and not in technologies that are most likely going to be out of date before they leave fulltime education. The OECD suggests that a greater emphasis needs to be placed on promoting strong levels of foundation skills such a digital literacies, higher order thinking competencies as well as social and emotional skills. The digital workforce of the future needs to learn how to learn to embrace the means to life-long learning in order that the learners stand a chance of a full engagement with society in the mid-21st Century. 
  QuickCode Labs Ltd (QCL) is a newly formed independent training provider delivering a pioneering approach to apprentice provision in collaboration with local businesses, Innovation Birmingham and local universities. QCL will provide a deeper insight and more meaningful employer engagement following the proposed technical routes of the Sainsbury Review. The partnership will support the further development and technical skills alongside digital and business skills, fully preparing students and providers for delivery of the Post-16 Skills Plan. QCL’s ambition is to work with local FE/HE education support partners and businesses to promote the skills necessary to enable the future digital workforce.
  QCL will integrate current learning pathways with the addition of innovative new digital tools and behaviours. Students will apply these tools when they enter employment alongside the practical skills they have also learned to create value in the work place. A key aspect of the project is the integration of current FE/HE led curriculum and pedagogy with the delivery of real business projects sponsored by host employers. 
  QCL believes that its proposition to create an environment that joins the dots bringing educators, industrialists and innovators from across the Solihull region into an exciting and invigorating space is unique. 
  The key difference to QCL’s approach is ‘Learning by Doing - Teaching students to Innovate’, which is a new and innovative approach to student and Apprenticeship Training. Students will be challenged to work on real business challenges sponsored by host employers. The approach recognises that employers are asking for employees to be able to apply themselves in the work place and demonstrate core practical skills covering aptitude and attitude coupled with the application of digital skills (the three A’s). A central tenant of the QCL’s offering is working closely with the city’s universities, initially Birmingham City University, to develop new digital tools that can be applied as part of the students learning and embedded into the learning curriculum.
  Blended learning will be used to produce a solution that combines several different delivery methods, such as collaboration software, Web-based courses, EPSS, and knowledge management practices. Blended learning will also be used to mix various event-based activities, including face- to-face classrooms, live e-learning, and self-paced learning to develop specific behaviours competency-driven learning, which blends performance support tools with knowledge management resources and mentoring to develop workplace competencies.
  QCL aims to raise the aspirations for all learners, ensuring the right advice is given, and that essential support is in place for students to achieve their career ambitions, including: igniting interest in jobs, raising awareness of different digitally enabled career pathways, specifically apprenticeship and inspiring career choices. QCL will work with all employers to create additional work experience, pre-employment and job opportunities related to the key growth sectors and major development areas.",http://quickcodelabs.com,UK,33

 We offer scholarships to those who cannot afford the training and we also aim to offer similar free training in real life settings to those who don't have access through partner organisations.

This means that people don’t have to move to the city to find work if they don’t want to. They can stay in the villages in Spain, Greece, Portugal, Italy and still do work that pays well and that matters. Villages where populations are declining will start to see a lift. Women who are highly skilled and have left work due to motherhood can earn a living working remotely from their home. Women who are encouraged to stay at home due to inequalities in certain countries can look to find remote work that inspires and empowers them.

Not only Digital Marketing, but also Personal Branding, User Experience Design, Blockchain, 3D Printing and Internet of Things. 
 
 We do this with the best Digital Innovators in Italy who teach for free for our students (e.g. Luca La Mesa who has been awarded by P&G Global Alumni as one of the top 40 under 40 and Gian Luca Comandini who at 27 frequently speaks in TV about Digital and Innovation). 
 
 Then we connect top talents with companies through some challenges that we give them. We started doing this in Italy where there is high youth unemployment and high demand for these skills. Students are really enthusiastic for this opportunity and we have been covered by Corriere della Sera (one of the most important newspaper in Italy). 
 
 We started in February 2017 with an offline Tour in high school where we met 3,000 students and we released the platform with the online courses last month. We have already 2,000 students who joined our platform thanks to the partnership already made with schools and we are developing more partnerships in these days (by the way we already did a test with a company who paid use for having new ideas developed for them by teens, but we didn't have a platform at that time). 
 
 We invested 40,000€ of our money to develop this idea and the big mission is to increase youth employment by teaching the skills that companies, especially small and medium (99,9% in Italy), really need to innovate so that they are not wiped out by big corporations. 
 
 We start from Italy, then Spain and Greece will follow as they have a similar situation. Then we are going to change the world!
